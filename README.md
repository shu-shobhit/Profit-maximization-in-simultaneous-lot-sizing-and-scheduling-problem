# Profit-maximization-in-simultaneous-lot-sizing-and-scheduling-problem

This project addresses a novel approach to Simultaneous Lot-sizing and Scheduling Problems by incorporating profit maximization as the primary objective. Traditional Lot sizing and scheduling models prioritize fulfilling all customer demands, which may not align with real-world business goals. 

This project proposed model optimize production planning for profit. The model consider a flexible demand range, where accepted demand can fluctuate between upper (predicted) and lower (minimum required) limits within each period. This allows for improved decision-making regarding accepted demand, lot-sizing, and scheduling, all integrated into a single model.

The objective function targets the maximization of the difference between sales revenue and production, inventory holding, and setup costs. The model outputs the accepted demand levels for each product in each period, along with the size and sequence of production batches. This integrated approach combines medium-term planning (product mix) with short-term scheduling (lot-sizing and scheduling) for comprehensive production planning.
